		<p>
		    I was quite bored today, so in order to
		    be a little productive  I decided to make a quick
		    little website. I am quite pleased with
		    the look so far, considering the fact
		    that I made this in like 2 hours.
		    I chose React with Next JS for the site generation.
		    CSS was done with Bootstrap and Bootstrap React.
		    Everything went fine, so there isn&apost
		    a lot to talk about - it&aposs just a simple
		    static site. I might be adding some
		    more to it later if I&aposm ever bored again.
